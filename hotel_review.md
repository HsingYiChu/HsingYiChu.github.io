## Hotel review and rating prediction - practice of unstructured text data analysis

**Project description:** This project mainly focused on practising text analysing tools, including Bag of Words (BOW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), on a dataset that contains a review section (text) and ratings (numerical grades). Furthermore, after the analysing tools gave us the numerical representation of the texts, a regression model was applied to predict the rating.

### 1. Data preparation

Explore the word frequency in the dataset after removing stop words and some highly mentioned neutral words (e.g. hotel) from the text.
