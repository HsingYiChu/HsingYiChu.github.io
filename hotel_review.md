## Hotel review and rating prediction - practice of unstructured text data analysis

**Project description:** This project mainly focused on practicing text analysing tools, including Bag of Words (BOW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), on a dataset that contains review section (text) and ratings (numerical grades). Furthermore, after the analysing tools give us the numerical representation of the texts, regression model was applied to predict the rating.

### 1. Data preparation

Remove stop words and some highely mentioned neutural words (e.g. hotel) from the text, and also remove the unwanted characters.
