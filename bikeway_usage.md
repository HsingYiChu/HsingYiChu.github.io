## The relationship between temperature and bikeway usage - the practice of removing seasonality from time series data

**Project description:** This project aims to analyse the usage patern of the brisbane bikeway, and invesigate if temperature is one of the factor that affect the usage. Furthermore, based on the findings, we examined bikeway data collected by the Brisbane City Council, and used it to make predictions of future cycle usage, using timeseries forecasting techniques. The data is from: https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/bikeway-counts. It comprises five .csv files, for years 2016-2020.
