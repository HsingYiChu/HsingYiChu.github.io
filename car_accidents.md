## Car accidents in QLD 2018 - geographical statistics, relationships with speed limits/crash types

**Project description:** The data used in this project was taken from a public dataset detailing vehicle incidents in Queensland for 2018. The project mainly focused on investigating the relationship between speed Limits and the severity of the accidents. For example, what speed limits produce the most or least severe outcomes? Besides, the relationship between crash types and crash severity was also examined. For example, what types of crashes produce the most or least severe outcomes? Last, for reference, the data was also organised geographically, allowing me to research this topic in the future further. All the data processing and charts were computed by R.

### 1. Crash Speed Limit and Crash Severity

Apply a stack bar chart to observe the relationship between speed limits and crash severity.

As the chart presented, to a certain degree, the speed limits of the road do impact the crash severity, in the way that the higher the speed limit, the higher percentage of the severe (fatal/hospitalisation) crash outcomes occur.

### 2. Crash Type and Crash Severity

Apply a stack bar chart to observe the relationship between crash types and crash severity.

From the graph above, it is observed that most minor injury cases are multi-vehicle involved. And, accidents that are “single vehicle” or “hit pedestrian” are more likely to result in more severe outcomes.

### 3. Crashes for Each Month of 2018
